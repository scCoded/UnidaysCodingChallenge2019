# UnidaysCodingChallenge2019
This was programmed in python so python version 3.6 or 3.7 should be installed to run this code, just download the UndidaysProject.py, open it in python and run it. Alternitevely, you can also run it from the command line by typing "python UnidaysProject.py"

My approach to the program was to create one single class list which contained the users items. The list would contain the item name, price and quantity. If the user decides to add the same item and this item was already present in the list, it simply updates the current quantity. This keeps the data structure neat and makes calculating discounts at the end more efficient. Discounts are applied by identifying how many of each item there are (item quantity is always one index after the name, so if we can find the position of the name we can find all other data we need) and using multiples (according to discount, so e.g. 2 for 10 would be multiples of 2) to see how many discounts can be applied.
